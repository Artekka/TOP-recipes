This is the initial project from The Odin Project's Foundations course.

The goal is the create a barebones recipe website that links to 3 different recipes. 

Each of those recipes will have a title, a photo of the finished recipe, a description, the ingredients, and lastly the steps required to make the recipe.

I believe later on we are going to revisit this project and spruce it up with CSS and JS. 

For now, I am submitting this and following the course step by step rather than skipping ahead.

My goal is to complete a portion of The Odin Project every day, whether that's a reading portion or a coding portion, preferrably a coding portion.

On to the next one!
